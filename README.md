# Databricks_projects

This project analyzes county-level greenhouse gas emissions data for the year 2023, combined with socio-economic and energy-related indicators such as population and energy consumption. The objective is to explore regional emissions trends, identify energy usage patterns, and examine how demographic and population factors relate to emission levels.

The analysis demonstrates practical data analysis skills, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), trend identification, and insight generation to support environmental assessments and data-driven policy discussions.
